Wgmsolver -Waveguide modal solver- is a small program to solve waveguide discontinuities by using 
the Modal Matching Method.

The objetives of this project are, by order of importance:

    - Learn
    - Help others that want to use the MMM, so they don't have to program everything from scratch
    - Optimize the code, so it becomes fast and light

So far we are focusing on two types of waveguides, rectangular and circular.


Questions, sugestions and requests are welcome :)
